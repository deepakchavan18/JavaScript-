//Getter and Setter - used too revoke the access of anything in the  program such as password
// Getters and setters are methods used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to access and modify the values of a class's attributes:
//   - Getters: Used to access the value of an attribute in a class.
//   - Setters: Used to set or modify the value of an attribute in a class.Â 
// Getters and setters are also known as accessors and mutators, respectively. They are commonly used to protect data, especially when creating classes
